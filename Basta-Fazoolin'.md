<h3 align="center">MAKING THE MENUS</h4>

<p>1. At <span title="Basta Fazoolin">Basta Fazoolin’</span> with my Heart our motto is simple: when you’re here with family, that’s great! We have four different menus: brunch, early-bird, dinner, and kids.

Create a `Menu class`.</p>

<p>2. Give <code>Menu</code> a constructor with the five parameters <em>self</em>, <em>name</em>, <em>items</em>, <em>start_time</em>, and <em>end_time</em>.</p>

<p>3. Let’s create our first menu: brunch. </br> Brunch is served from 11am to 4pm. The following items are sold during brunch:

```python
{
  'pancakes': 7.50, 'waffles': 9.00, 'burger': 11.00, 'home fries': 4.50, 'coffee': 1.50, 'espresso': 3.00, 'tea': 1.00, 'mimosa': 10.50, 'orange juice': 3.50
}
```
